# CI/CD Goals and Success Criteria for Text2SQL Agent Application

## Overview
This document outlines the goals and success criteria for implementing Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines for the Text2SQL Agent application, which leverages the LangGraph agentic framework, FastAPI, and containerized deployments to Azure.

---

## Goals

### 1. Continuous Integration (CI)
- **Automated Build & Test:**
  - Ensure every code change (commit or pull request) triggers an automated workflow that builds the backend, installs dependencies, and runs all tests and evaluations.
- **Agent Evaluation:**
  - Automatically start the FastAPI backend and run the evaluation suite to validate agent performance and correctness on every change.
- **Feedback & Artifacts:**
  - Provide clear feedback on build/test/evaluation status in GitHub checks.
  - Upload evaluation results and logs as artifacts for review.
- **Fail Fast:**
  - Prevent merging of code that fails build, test, or evaluation steps.

### 2. Continuous Deployment (CD)
- **Automated Container Build & Push:**
  - Build Docker images for backend (and frontend, if needed) and push to Azure Container Registry (ACR) on successful CI or manual trigger.
- **Dev Deployment (Azure App Service):**
  - Deploy the backend container to Azure App Service for development/staging environments.
  - Set all required environment variables securely from GitHub secrets.
- **Prod Deployment (Azure Kubernetes Service):**
  - Deploy the backend container to AKS for production, using best practices for secrets, scaling, and reliability.
- **Rollback & Traceability:**
  - Enable easy rollback to previous versions and maintain traceability from commit to deployment.

## Success Criteria

### CI Success Criteria
- [ ] Every push/PR triggers the CI workflow automatically.
- [ ] The backend is built and all dependencies are installed without errors.
- [ ] The FastAPI backend starts and responds to health checks in CI.
- [ ] The evaluation suite runs and produces accurate pass/fail results for each build.
- [ ] Evaluation results and logs are uploaded as artifacts.
- [ ] CI fails if any build, test, or evaluation step fails.
- [ ] PRs cannot be merged unless CI passes.

### CD Success Criteria
- [ ] Docker images are built and pushed to ACR on successful CI or manual trigger.
- [ ] The backend is deployed to Azure App Service (dev) with correct environment variables.
- [ ] The deployment is automated and does not require manual intervention.
- [ ] The backend is accessible at the expected endpoint after deployment.
- [ ] (Prod) The backend is deployed to AKS with correct configuration and secrets.
- [ ] Rollback to previous deployments is possible and documented.
- [ ] Deployment status and logs are visible in GitHub Actions.

---

## Stretch Goals (Optional)
- Automated deployment of frontend container.
- Blue/green or canary deployments for production.
- Automated integration tests against deployed endpoints.
- Slack/Teams notifications for pipeline status.
- Infrastructure as Code (Bicep/Terraform) for Azure resources.

---

## Summary
A robust CI/CD pipeline will ensure that the Text2SQL Agent application is always tested, reliable, and can be deployed to Azure environments with confidence, supporting rapid iteration and high code quality.
